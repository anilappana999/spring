Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly.
 It internally uses setter or constructor injection.
 here we are discusing about autowireByName
In case of constructor autowiring mode, spring container injects the dependency by highest parameterized constructor.

If you have 3 constructors in a class, zero-arg, one-arg and two-arg then injection will be performed by calling the two-arg constructor.

<bean id="b" class="org.sssit.B"></bean>  
<bean id="a" class="org.sssit.A" autowire="constructor"></bean>
