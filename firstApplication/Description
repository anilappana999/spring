here i have mentioned steps for creating first spring application

step1:create java project
step2:Add required jar files 
step3:create a bean  class containing the name property only.
step4:configure applicationContext.xml 
The bean element is used to define the bean for the given class.
The property subelement of bean specifies the property of the Student class named name.
The value specified in the property element will be set in the Student class object by the IOC container.
step5:create Test class for testing springApplication here im using ioc container(BeanFactory)
The Resource object represents the information of applicationContext.xml file.
The Resource is the interface and the ClassPathResource is the implementation class of the Reource interface.
The BeanFactory is responsible to return the bean. 
The XmlBeanFactory is the implementation class of the BeanFactory. 
There are many methods in the BeanFactory interface. One method is getBean(), 
which returns the object of the associated class.

in further projects lets discuss about ioc container more deeply
